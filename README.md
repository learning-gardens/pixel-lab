Pixel Lab is a garden within [Learning Gardens](http://learning-gardens.co/), dedicated to working on creative technological projects and teaching each other how we can use computers as artistic tools. If you're interested in web art, VR/AR, 3D modeling, game development, or making weird websites... this is the garden for you.

## Goals

👽 To have fun and find happiness in the community and in our computers
