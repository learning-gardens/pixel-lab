Pixel Lab is a garden within [Learning Gardens](http://learning-gardens.co/), dedicated to working on creative technological projects and teaching each other how we can use computers as artistic tools. If you're interested in web art, VR/AR, 3D modeling, game development, or making weird websites... this is the garden for you.

## Goals

- To create study groups with other members to help structure our learning and keep us motivated
- To collaborate on small/large/quarterly/longterm/brief/complicated/simple projects
- To have fun and find happiness in the community and in our computers 👽

## Projects

These are projects our members are currently working on and may want help with. See something interesting? Talk to the project creator about it and see how you can contribute!

* [ART CONNEXIONS](https://github.com/morgane/art-connexions), by [morgane](https://github.com/morgane). A D3 project mapping out the relationships between visual artists since 1400.

## Resources and Tutorials

A collection of resources for various tools, and the people who know something about them. If you're interested in learning about something, you are encouraged to reach out to other members and see if anyone wants to learn about it, too. Study groups are awesome!
